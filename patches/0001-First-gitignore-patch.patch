+# Do not include files and directories created by your personal work environment, such as the IDE

+
+# This .gitignore file contains rules for files generated by working with CircuitPython libraries,
+# including building Sphinx, testing with pip, and creating a virual environment, as well as the
+# MacOS and IDE-specific files generated by using MacOS in general, or the PyCharm or VSCode IDEs.
+
+# If you find that there are files being generated on your machine that should not be included in
+# your git commit, you should create a .gitignore_global file on your computer to include the
+# files created by your personal setup. To do so, follow the two steps below.
+
+# First, create a file called .gitignore_global somewhere convenient for you, and add rules for
+# the files you want to exclude from git commits.
+
+# Second, configure Git to use the exclude file for all Git repositories by running the
+# following via commandline, replacing "path/to/your/" with the actual path to your newly created
+# .gitignore_global file:
+# git config --global core.excludesfile path/to/your/.gitignore_global
